# Virtual Tourist
This app allows users specify travel locations around the world, and create virtual photo albums for each location. The locations and photo albums are stored in Core Data.

Warning: Developer must provide their own Flickr API key within the FlickrParameterValues struct in FlickrRequestConstants.swift file, in order for photos to be downloaded.
